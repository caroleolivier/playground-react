Minimal React Starter
---
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caroleolivier/minimal-react-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caroleolivier/minimal-react-starter)

A minimal setup to write web applications using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

Testing requires extra dependencies to [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

Initially created thanks to this great [7-step walkthrough](http://andrewhfarmer.com/build-your-own-starter/#0-intro) guide.
